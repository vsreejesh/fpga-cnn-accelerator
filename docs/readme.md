# Documentation

This folder contains detailed documentation related to the CNN hardware accelerator project.

## Contents

- **CNN HARDWARE ACCELERATOR.pdf**:  
  Comprehensive project report describing architecture, design methodology, module descriptions, flow, and implementation details of the FPGA-based CNN accelerator.

- **Simulation Results PNGs**:  
  Visual waveform captures and other simulation output images demonstrating the functionality and correctness of the RTL design during testbench verification.

## Purpose

These documents provide in-depth understanding and verification evidence of the CNN accelerator design. They are intended for:
- Developers seeking a detailed architectural overview.
- Researchers and engineers interested in replicating, learning, or extending the project.
- Reviewers and collaborators who require proof of design operation and effectiveness.

## Usage

Review the PDF for design insights and study the simulation PNGs to validate hardware behavior and timing. This documentation complements the RTL source and testbench code available in other repository folders.
