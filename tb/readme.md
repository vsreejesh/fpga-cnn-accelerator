# Testbench Files

This folder contains the Verilog testbenches used to verify the functionality of the CNN hardware accelerator RTL design.

## Overview

- The testbenches instantiate the top-level CNN module and provide stimulus for simulation.
- They load sample input images (28Ã—28 pixels) and kernel weights.
- The testbenches generate necessary clock and reset signals.
- They monitor the CNN output prediction and `done` signals to validate correct inference.
- Console messages display classification results for easy interpretation.

## Usage

- Run simulations using your preferred Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado).
- Testbench files are designed to be self-contained for straightforward testing.
- Modify input datasets or add new tests for extended verification.

## Included Files

- `cat_or_dog.v`: Main testbench for binary classification CNN, includes image loading and output checking.
- Additional helper files or scripts may be included for simulation automation.
